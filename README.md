# Cryptoclustering

In this assignment, I have used Python and unsupervised learning to predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes.

 Using fewer features to cluster the data using KMeans allows us to visualize the groups that are closer and tighter clusters. It shows the means values and variations in the clusters. We are able to eliminate the outliers that are in the group 2 and 3.
